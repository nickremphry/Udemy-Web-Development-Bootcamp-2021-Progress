# Udemy-Web-Development-Bootcamp-2021-Progress
This repository will be used as a way to track my progress through Udemy's course "Web Developer Bootcamp 2021".

By tracking my progress, I will provide my completion of exercises given through the course, as well as display any personal projects that may be created in the process. My intention is to demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, all concepts that are taught and explained thoroughly through the course.
